<h2>Flextype is succesfully installed!</h2>
<p>You can start editing the content and customising your site.</p>

<h3>Edit this Page</h3>
<p>To edit this page, simply go to the folder you installed Flextype, and then browse to the `/site/pages/home/` folder and open the `page.md` file in your editor.</p>

<h3>Create a New page</h3>
<p>Creating a new page is very simple in Flextype.</p>

<p>
1. Launch your text editor and paste this sample text:
<code>
    <pre>
        ---
        title: My New Page
        ---
        &lt;h1&gt;My New Page!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is the body of &lt;b&gt;My New Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
</code>
2. Save this file in the <code>/site/pages/my-new-page/</code> folder as <code>page.md</code> and its will be available by this url: http://your_site_url/my-new-page
</p>
<p>That is it!</p>
